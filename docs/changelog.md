## 2026-10-13 23:21 [BUG-P0]

MySQL packet decoders panicked on truncated input (`Buf::get_*`, `advance`, `split_to`), which exits the process because the release profile aborts on panic. All decoders in `gated-database-protocols` now use checked reads and return a protocol error. Regression tests: `mysql/protocol/truncation_tests.rs`.

## 2026-10-13 23:21 [progress]

Repository audit of `9a50100` recorded as three tasks (`20261013-2315-*`). First task: decoder fix above, clippy `indexing_slicing` error in `gated-admin`, and `web/dist` ordering in the CI Integration job and `docker/Dockerfile` (which now also builds for an explicit glibc target on the pinned toolchain).

## 2026-10-13 23:40 [decision]

Lint policy moved from `Cranky.toml` to `[workspace.lints]` (`warnings = deny`, `unsafe_code = forbid`, the previous clippy denies) and every crate root carries `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. `rust-version` is 1.95, the same release as the pinned toolchain, so every CI job builds on the MSRV and no separate MSRV job is added. Clippy pedantic/nursery groups are not enabled.

## 2026-10-13 23:40 [progress]

CI gains formatting, typos, cargo-nextest (profile `ci`) and doctest gates, pins bun, and builds the release binary with `--locked`. `once_cell` is replaced by `std::sync::LazyLock`/`OnceLock`. `deny.toml` bans `openssl` and `native-tls` and denies unknown sources. Path remapping for release builds is now expanded by the shell; the `.cargo/config.toml` entries were literal `$HOME`/`$PWD` strings and had no effect.

## 2026-10-13 23:40 [pitfall]

`cargo deny check advisories` fails on RUSTSEC-2024-0449 (`unsafe-libyaml`, unmaintained, via `serde_yaml`); handling is pending a decision. One nextest run aborted at process exit after a passing SQLCipher test; tracked as `20261013-2332-sqlcipher-exit-abort`.

## 2026-10-14 00:10 [progress]

Shutdown now closes live sessions and waits up to ten seconds for them to deregister and for recording writers to flush (`Services::shutdown`). Before this change a SIGTERM dropped up to five seconds of buffered recording data and left recordings without an end time. Traffic recording downloads are streamed. Core dumps are disabled at startup and panics are logged through tracing.

## 2026-10-14 00:10 [decision]

Workspace migrated to edition 2024 and resolver 3 with `cargo fix --edition`. `tail_expr_drop_order` flagged 130 sites where a tail-expression temporary is now dropped before locals; they were sampled (mostly awaited futures, lock guards and database handles released earlier), not reviewed one by one. `wrap_stream` gained a precise capture bound because the new `impl Trait` capture rules tied its result to the handle lock guard. `rand`'s `gen` is called as `r#gen` until the dependency is upgraded.
